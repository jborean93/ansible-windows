# Scripts
This repo contains the following scripts

## Upgrade-PowerShell.ps1
The `Upgrade-PowerShell.ps1` script is used to upgrade the installed version of
PowerShell on a Windows host to a newer version. Ansible requires at least
version `3.0` to be install but some modules may require a newer version.

This script can be run on the following hosts
* Windows Server 2008 (with SP2 installed)
* Windows Server 2008 R2 (with SP1 installed)
* Windows Server 2012
* Windows Server 2012 R2
* Windows Server 2016
* Windows 7 (with SP1 installed)
* Windows 8.1
* Windows 10

When calling the script, the `-Version` parameter is used to specify the target
PowerShell version to install. The versions that can be set as the target are:
* 3.0
* 4.0
* 5.1 (default if not set)

All OS' can be upgraded to 5.1 except for Windows Server 2008. If running
on Powershell 1.0 then this script will first upgrade the version to 2.0
before running the checks. This is because a lot of the upgrade paths need
this version installed as a baseline. If the .NET Framework version
installed is less than 4.5.2, it will be upgraded to 4.5.2 as this is
supported on all hosts and is required for v5.0.

As multiple packages can be installed in this process, multiple reboots may
be required to continue with the install. If a reboot is required the
script will detect if the 'username' and 'password' parameters have been
supplied. If they have been supplied it will automatically reboot and login
to continue the install process until it is all complete. If these
parameters are not set then it will prompt the user for a reboot and
require the user to log back in manually after the reboot before
continuing.

A log of this process is created in
`$env:SystemDrive\temp\upgrade_powershell.log` which is usually `C:\temp\`.
This log can used to see how the script ran after an automatic reboot.

To run this script from any version of PowerShell, the following commands can
be run

```PowerShell
$url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jborean93/ansible-windows/master/scripts/Upgrade-PowerShell.ps1"
$file = "$env:SystemDrive\temp\Upgrade-PowerShell.ps1"
$username = "Administrator"
$password = "Password"

(New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force

# version can be 3.0, 4.0 or 5.1
&$file -Version 5.1 -Username $username -Password $password -Verbose
```

When setting `username` or `password`, these values are stored in plaintext in
the registry until the script is complete. Be sure to run the script below to
clear them out.

```PowerShell
# this isn't needed but is a good security practice to complete
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Force

$reg_winlogon_path = "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"
Set-ItemProperty -Path $reg_winlogon_path -Name AutoAdminLogon -Value 0
Remove-ItemProperty -Path $reg_winlogon_path -Name DefaultUserName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-ItemProperty -Path $reg_winlogon_path -Name DefaultPassword -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Install-WMF3Hotfix.ps1
When running on PowerShell v3.0, there is a bug with the WinRM service that
limits the amount of memory available to WinRM. Without this hotfix installed,
Ansible will fail to execute certain commands on the Windows host.

The script will install the WinRM hotfix [KB2842230](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2842230/-out-of-memory-error-on-a-computer-that-has-a-customized-maxmemorypers)
which fixes the memory issues that occur when running over WinRM with WMF 3.0.

The script will;
1. Detect if running on PS version 3.0 and exit if it is not
2. Check if `KB2842230` is already installed and exit if it is
3. Download the hotfix from Microsoft server's based on the OS version
4. Extract the .msu file from the downloaded hotfix
5. Install the .msu silently
6. Detect if a reboot is required and prompt whether the user wants to restart

Once the install is complete, if the install process returns an exit
code of `3010`, it will ask the user whether to restart the computer now
or whether it will be done later.

To run this script, the following commands can be run:

```PowerShell
$url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jborean93/ansible-windows/master/scripts/Install-WMF3Hotfix.ps1"
$file = "$env:SystemDrive\temp\Install-WMF3Hotfix.ps1"

(New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File $file -Verbose
```

## Install-WMF5.ps1

The script will install the [Windows Management Framework 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616). 

**NOTE: This script WILL NOT run with using remote invocations, because of Microsoft's limitation with running Windows Updates remotely**

The script will;
1. Detect if running on PS version 3.0 and exit if it is not
2. Check current version of Powershell installed. If the version is 5 or greater than exit
3. Download WMF 5 from Microsoft server's based on the OS version
4. Extract the .msu file from the downloaded hotfix
5. Install the .msu silently
6. Detect if a reboot is required and prompt whether the user wants to restart

Once the install is complete, if the install process returns an exit
code of `3010`, it will ask the user whether to restart the computer now
or whether it will be done later.

To run this script, the following commands can be run:

```PowerShell
$url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junaidali/ansible-windows/master/scripts/Install-WMF5.ps1"
$file = "$env:SystemDrive\temp\Install-WMF5.ps1"

(New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File $file -Verbose
```


## Install-WMF5.vbs
The script will install the [Windows Management Framework 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616). 

**NOTE: This script WILL RUN with using remote invocations as it uses dism to install the cab patches rather than wusa.exe**

The script will;
1. Check current version of Powershell installed. If the version is 5 or greater than exit
2. Download WMF 5 from Microsoft server's based on the OS version
3. Extract the .msu file from the downloaded hotfix
4. Extract the .msu file to generate cabs
5. Lookup PkgInstallOrder.txt within the extracted files. If it is found use the list of cabs in that file and install them sequentially using dism.exe
6. If PkgInstallOrder.txt does not exists within the extracted files, use the cab file not named WSUSSCAN.CAB with the directory and install it using dism.exe
6. Does not force reboot. 


**NOTE: Make sure to reboot after successful completion. This is by design, as the script will be used along with external provisioning tools like Terraform or Configuration tools like ansible that should be handling reboots.**

To run this script, the following commands can be run:

```PowerShell
$url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junaidali/ansible-windows/master/scripts/Install-WMF5.vbs"
$file = "$env:SystemDrive\temp\Install-WMF5.vbs"

(New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)
cscript.exe $file
```
